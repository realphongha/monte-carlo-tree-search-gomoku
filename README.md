# mnk-game-bot
AI bot to play [m,n,k-games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M,n,k-game) (Tic-tac-toe, Gomoku...) with simple Pygame GUI for Player vs. Bot.

# Implemented stuffs
## Bot algorithms
* Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) with Single-run parallelization:
```
@inproceedings{cazenave2007parallelization,
  title={On the parallelization of UCT},
  author={Cazenave, Tristan and Jouandeau, Nicolas},
  booktitle={Computer games workshop},
  year={2007}
}
```
## Game configs
* Tic-tac-toe
* Gomoku 7x7
* Gomoku 15x15 (MCTS seems not to be effective yet because of speed problem)
## Cython optimization
* MCTS:
```
For end-game board checking
For getting possible moves on board
For calculating UCB + score (not so big improvement)
```
